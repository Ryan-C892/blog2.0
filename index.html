                <p>I'll be honest. This is my first time getting a website together let alone a blog. I've always been passionate about games since I was young and I wanted to share that passion in a creative way. I will offer my thoughts on recent and upcoming titles and the latest in gaming news. I'll post the occasional guide if I get the time with each game being decided by a poll. This blog will also promote the indie scene with reivews on the latest indie developed titles.</p>

              <p>I believe every reviewer has a genre they like and dislike. Some people like RPGs, others like FPS games. I don't think it's a flaw for game reviewers similar to poor hand-eye coordination or lack of focus. It's human nature, and I think it helps people think for themselves and find a reviewer who has the same interests. The genres I enjoy the most happen to be RPGs. This isn't to say that this blog will focus mostly on RPGs or that I'll give every RPG a glowing review. RPG is a broad subject that has many categories that fit a basic checklist. At the end of the day, I still have to build a case and present it to the best of my ability.</p>
